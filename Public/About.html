    <p>Hello, I'm Danish Raimi, currently residing in Selangor. I'm a dedicated computer science student with a strong passion for software engineering. I'm on a journey to expand my knowledge and skills in this field, and I'm excited about the endless possibilities that the world of technology offers. When I'm not immersed in coding and programming, you can often find me exploring new tech trends or enjoying some quality time with friends and family. I look forward to the exciting challenges and opportunities that the future holds in the world of software engineering</p>
